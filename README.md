# CROWDFUNDING SMART CONTRACT

This is a project that enables users crowdfund for projects. Users can create campaigns soliciting for donations, donors can donate the custom erc20 token (crowd token) which can be gotten from the vendor contract. When funding goals are not met after the set deadline, funds are returned to donors.
